# Cartero Screen Cast Outline
## Intro

In this screencast, I am going to walk through the setup and workflow of using Cartero with an [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) server. Cartero is a powerful client side asset managment tool that enables developers to create reusable asset bundles and store page specific assets alongside their corresponding views.

We'll create a simple Express server and a homepage for our app. Then we will setup Cartero and use it to add JS and CSS to our homepage.

## Install dependencies and create Express server
First off, let's a create new folder for our project called `myApp` and install all our dependencies with npm:

```
npm install express cartero cartero-express-hook jade grunt grunt-contrib-watch
```

Now we can create a simple Express server at `server.js` that uses the [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) template engine for view rendering:
#### `server.js`
```javascript
var express = require( 'express' );
var app = express();

app.set( 'views' , 'views' );
app.engine( 'jade', require( 'jade' ).__express );
app.use( express.static( 'static' ) );

app.get( '/', function( req, res ) {
	res.render( 'home/home.jade' );
});

app.listen( '7000' );
```
And a homepage view at `views/home/home.jade`:
#### `views/home/home.jade`
```jade
doctype
html
	head
	body
		form.login-form
			h3 Login
			input(type="text")
			button(type="submit") login
```
Then lets run: 
```
node server.js
```
and open up [http://localhost:7000/](http://localhost:7000/) to see that our Jade homepage view has been rendered and served.
## Page specifc assets
Lets add some styles to our homepage by creating a `home.css`:
#### `views/home/home.css`
```css
body {
	background: hsl(0, 0%, 97%);
}

.login-form {
	background: white;
}
```
Lets will also create an `assets/` folder that we will use later to store reuseable asset bundles.
```
mkdir assets
```

## Setting up Cartero build
Now that we have created a `home.css`, let's get it included on the homepage. First, we need to add variables to our `home.jade` template that get replaced by the `script` and `link` tags of our assets:
#### `views/home/home.jade`
```jade
doctype
html
	head
		| !{cartero_css} 
	body
		form.login-form
			h3 Login
			input(type="text")
			button(type="submit") login
		| !{cartero_js}
```

Then let's create a Gruntfile to run the Cartero build task:
#### `Gruntfile.js`
```javascript
module.exports = function( grunt ) {
	grunt.initConfig( {

		cartero : {

			options : {

				projectDir : __dirname,

				library : {
					path : "assets/"
				},

				views : {
					path : "views/",
					viewFileExt : ".jade"
				},

				publicDir : "static/",

				tmplExt : ".tmpl",

			},

			dev : {
				options : {
					mode : "dev"
				}

			}

		}
	} );

	grunt.loadNpmTasks( "cartero" );
	grunt.loadNpmTasks( "grunt-contrib-watch" );
};
```
*Cartero uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to run the asset bundler, if you are unfarmilar with Grunt or don't have it installed check out the [getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).*

Let's start the build task with the `--watch` option so that it will be rerun whenever we save a file:
```
grunt cartero --watch
```
This will generate a `cartero.json` file and a `static` folder that looks like: 
```
static/
├── library-assets
└── view-assets
    └── home
        └── home.css
```
You should never edit the `cartero.json` file or any of the contents of the `static/library-assets` or `static/view-assets` folders because they are generated by the Catero Grunt task and any changes you make will be overwritten when the task is run.
## Hooking Cartero up to Express
Now that we have our template and build task setup, we can use [Cartero Express hook](https://github.com/rotundasoftware/cartero-express-hook) to include asset `script` and `link` tags into our Jade templates. Let's add the hook into our middleware stack in `server.js`.

#### `server.js`
```javascript
var express = require( 'express' );
var app = express();
var carteroMiddleware = require( 'cartero-express-hook' );

app.set( 'views' , 'views' );
app.engine( 'jade', require( 'jade' ).__express );
app.use( express.static( 'static' );
app.use( carteroMiddleware( __dirname ) );

app.get( '/', function( req, res ) {
	res.render( 'home/home.jade' );
});

app.listen( '7000' );
```
Now that the middleware is hooked up we can run:
```
node server.js
```
and open [http://localhost:7000/](http://localhost:7000/) to see that our homepage has the `home.css` asset included. We have succesfully included our stylesheet with Cartero! Let's check out how we can use Cartero to manage reuseable asset bundles.
## Creating asset bundles
First, we will create some asset bundles to be included in our `home.jade` template. We'll create two bunlde inside our `assets` folder. Our first bundle will be __Form__, this will contain some generic styles that we want used on forms throughout our app.

Lets create a `assets/Form/` folder with a `form.css` file for our base form styles:
#### `assets/Form/form.css`
```css
form {
	border: 1px solid gainsboro;
	border-radius: 4px;
	padding: 15px;
}
```
We also have CSS and JS that is specific to the login form component used on our homepage, let's create a __LoginForm__ bundle for these assets. For the login form styling, let's create a `loginForm.css`:

#### `assets/LoginForm/loginForm.css`
```css
.login-form {
	font-size: 1.4em;
}

.login-form button {
	color: white;
	background: green;
}
```
And for the login form JS, let's create a `loginFrom.js`:
#### `assets/LoginForm/loginForm.js`
```javascript
alert('Please login!');
```
On any page we use the assets from our __LoginForm__ bundle, we also want the assets from the __Form__ bundle. With Cartero all we have to do is list the __Form__ bundle as a dependency of the __LoginForm__ bundle in a `bundle.json` file:
#### `assets/LoginForm/bundle.json`
```javascript
{
	"dependencies": [ "Form" ]
}
```
Lets checkout our homepage with the new bundled assets included by running:
```
node server.js
```
and opening [http://localhost:7000/](http://localhost:7000/)


## Using Cartero with Bower 
_If you are unfarmiliar with Bower or don't have it installed, check out the [Bower docs](http://bower.io/)._
Bower makes it easy to manage third party libraries and their dependencies. Bower components can be used as Cartero bundles and their dependencies in `bower.json` are automatically resolved by Cartero.

Let's get started by installing [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/):
```
bower install ember
```
Ember and its dependencies (jQuery, and Handlebars) are now installed, let's get them accessable as Cartero bundles. Unlike the Cartero bundles, the Bower compontents have files that we dont want included such as tests and minified versions. Because of this we need a `bowerBundleProperties.json` file to tell Cartero which files we want.
#### `bowerBundleProperties.json`
```javascript
{
	"ember" : {
		"whitelistedFiles" : [ "ember.js" ]
	},
	"jquery" : {
		"whitelistedFiles" : [ "jquery.js" ]
	},
	"handlebars" : {
		"whitelistedFiles" : [ "handlebars.js" ]
	}
}
```

Then we'll edit the Cartero Grunt task config to use the `bower_components` as a source for bundles and to use `bowerBundleProperties.json` as config for those bundles:
#### `Gruntfile.js`
```javascript
module.exports = function( grunt ) {
	grunt.initConfig( {

		cartero : {

			options : {

				projectDir : __dirname,

				library : [
					{
						path : "assets/"
					},
					{
						path : "bower_components/",
						bundleProperties : grunt.file.readJSON( "bowerBundleProperties.json" )
					}
				],

				views : {
					path : "views/",
					viewFileExt : ".jade"
				},

				publicDir : "static/",

				tmplExt : ".tmpl",

				preprocessingTasks : [ {
					name : "sass",
					inExt : ".scss",
					outExt : ".css"
				} ],

			},

			dev : {
				options : {
					mode : "dev"
				}

			}

		}
	} );

	grunt.loadNpmTasks( "cartero" );
	grunt.loadNpmTasks( "grunt-contrib-watch" );
};
```
Now let's require the Ember bundle in our `home.jade`:
#### `views/home/home.jade`
```jade
// ##cartero_requires "LoginForm", "ember"
doctype
html
	head
		| !{cartero_css} 
	body
		form.login-form
			h3 Login
			input(type="text")
			button(type="submit") login
		| !{cartero_js}
```
and let's run:
```
node server.js
```
When we open [http://localhost:7000/](http://localhost:7000/), we can see that Ember and all of its dependencies were included onto the homepage.
